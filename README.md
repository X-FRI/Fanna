# Fanna

> A cross-platform Lua runtime written in F#

</div>

## Motivation

Lua is a small and fast language that can be easily embedded in various applications or systems. 

*Fanna is an exploratory learning project.* 

- Through .NET Core F#, Lua can be cross-platform and allow interaction with F#. 
- Through Fable, Lua can run in the browser and interact with JavaScript.
- Of course, it is also compatible with existing Lua.
